<p1>Blog: is all about sharing content about different things with the people all over world<br>getting likes comments from them to know what they think about it..</p1>
<h1>Blog-post 1</h1><p5>NATURE BLOG </p5>
<img src="./photos/Cool+Nature+Background+Wallpapers2.jpg"><br>
<p2><b>Is the greenry of our nature exhausting day by day...?</b></p2>
<p>The world environment is going too much worst condition day by day as we use our natural recourses indiscriminately and fail to manage our waste. Our total environmental condition deteriorate in everyday life but we yet not concern ourselves for save us from different types of natural calamities and extinction of several types of animals spaces groups, it is true that only human are responsible for polluting environmenrt, but if we have a little bit concern than it will make us positive thinker to save our environment.</p>

  <h>  Population explosion:</h>
    
   <p> The first and foremost emerging problem in the world is population explosion that directly impact in our environment and every vital element of our environment such like water Tree,air,and  many other things . It causes poverty inflation of money, high price rate of daily commodities and creates thousands of problems which are too hard to solve us. On the other hand for being increased population growth we destroy our valuable natural resources and make a devastated impact for ourselves.</p>
    
   <h> Increase of CFCs in air:</h>
    
    <p>For the lacking of Trees and forest area CFC'S are increasing day by day for this reasons worlds temperature are increasing which directly impact to melt polar ice caps and rise of sea levels which causes undergoing our firm land into the water that directly impact a negative effect on our environment .
    
    It is true that by running or establishing an atomic project which causes huge carbon dioxide gas in our environment though it's a beneficiary side to create huge amount of energy but it has hundreds of harmful sides yet people of the rich country run these projects rather to stop the project as a result we can easily notice the intensiveness of natural calamities at present year comparing the past year.</p>

   <h> Waste in everywhere:</h>

<p>Today it's a normal matter to through our daily waste everywhere these waste melt and pollute our environment gradually and spread out jams for this reasons our local people get sick easily. Open waste pollute our environment as well as our surroundings but everyone know about the bad effect of waste but do not take immediate steps to save their living area .

At present the real situation are so dangerous that we hardly think because not only our land area but also our vast sea level area are polluted extremely, for this reasons our sea water get polluted and produce huge amount of toxic chemicals and that chemical fall a harmful effect in our sea living species . The industrial waste mismanagement is the main responsible for this huge area pollution. If we can manage our industrial waste than we can save our sea level area as well our environment as we know sea is the big source of human food so it s a necessary duty to save our see as much as possible.</p>

<h>Immense industrial growth:</h>

<p>As people are increasing rapidly and for that people need work place and for this reasons immense industry grow everywhere rather to think environment save .Though industry plays an important rules to rapid grow our economy but excessive industry set up run a negative impact on our environment. A proper management of industrial growth can bring us a better output in our economy and our environment.

Every government should impose a law so that industrial waste cannot get mixed in our river, cannel, and see water as water is a valuable element in our environment, on the other hand chemical produce industry should not allow near the river side area to save our environment .

It is true that emitting smoke from the industry also causes air pollution and for this we should take proper steps so that our air cannot get excessively polluted by industrial fume</p>
<h>Destroy forest:</h>

   <p> Destruction of forest is the main reason for create environmental problem, it is the root cause of increase of carbon di oxide in our environment and that increased level carbon di oxide create several types of natural disaster in every year. At present the number of disaster are gradually increasing in a year and make irrecoverable loss which destroy thousands of human lives and create economic loss of the affected country.
    
    For being save ourselves we should save our environment so that we can save our future generation if world temperature is increasing like present situation than our land area  must go under water so we should aware immediately before situation going out of control .

    <h1>Blog-post 2</h1><p5>FOOD BLOG </p5><br>
<img src="./photos/Food-Blog.jpg"><br>
<P2>What is healthy Food..?</P2>
<p>When many people think of healthy food, they think boring and difficult to prepare. Fortunately, neither of those are true! Many healthy meals are easy to prepare and very tasty. Every summer it's a good idea to set some sort of goal. This summer why not commit to living a healthier life, eating better, and sharpening your cooking skills? Below is a list of blogs that will inspire your healthy cooking.</p>

    <h>A Couple Cooks</h>
    
   <p> A Couple Cooks was created by husband and wife Alex and Sonja Overhiser. The blog has gotten a lot of love over the years for its recipes and cooking tips. On the website, you can explore categories of main courses, soups, salads, breakfast, and dessert (Yes, even dessert can be healthy!). The blog is regularly updated, so you won't have any trouble finding a recipe that you like. Skillet Eggplant Marinara is one recipe that the couple recently published. It's very easy to make and looks delicious.</p>
    
    <h>Green Kitchen Stories</h>
    
    <p>Green Kitchen Stories focuses on simple vegetarian recipes. The first thing that attracted me to this blog was the colorful photos on the homepage. Each photo looks so delicious it's difficult to resist reading each recipe. Some of the recipes, though, can be advanced. If you're an inexperienced cook, you should wait until you feel confident in your cooking skills before attempting some of these recipes. I recommend starting with the Blueberry & Apricot Super Salad.</p>
    
    <h>Sunday Morning Banana Pancakes</h>
    
    <p>How can you dislike a name like Sunday Morning Banana Pancakes? In addition to recipes, this wonderful blog features some helpful DIY tips on things like canning and drying herbs. While all of the recipes are vegan, a handful of the breakfast recipes outline some egg alternatives. Take a look at the site's recipe box for a full list of all of the recipes. There are so many delicious recipes to go through!</p>
    
   <h>Sprouted Kitchen</h>
    
   <p> Sprouted Kitchen is another blog run by a married couple. Sara is the main author of the site, and she stresses cooking in tune with the season and using natural ingredients. There is a helpful section on the site called Tools that lists some recommendations for knives, pots, and pans. If you're just starting to cook, then you can hold off on purchasing anything, but it's something to keep in mind for the future when you become more experienced. I especially like Sprouted Kitchen's bread recipes. Check out their Cast Iron Cornbread.</p>
